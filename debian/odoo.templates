Template: odoo-nginx/workers
Type: string
Default: 8
Description: Number of http workers ?
 This depends on the number of CPU and the number of concurrent users you expect.
 As a rule of thumb, this formula gives good results: (#CPU * 2) + 1.
 Also, 1 workers ~= 6 concurrent users

Template: odoo-nginx/server_name
Type: string
Default: foo.bar.com
Description: Server name for nginx configuration
 This is what nginx will listen for to handle requests for the Odoo server.
